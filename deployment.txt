- install necessary packages:
apt install docker.io nmap firewalld python3 python3-pip

#docker-compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose

- clone git repository:
git clone https://github.com/calm-tedesco/exercise-docker

- run docker-compose:
docker-compose up -d

Done! It should be up and running already.

There are two servers: exercise_python and mongodb
exercise_python is listening for requests on port 4001 (/concat-and-send):
http://localhost:4001/concat-and-send?name=<name>

mongodb is listening for requests on port 4002 (/save-in-db):
http://localhost:4002/save-in-db?name=<name>&new_name=<name_concatenated>

We can execute the following commands to see that the setup works:

curl -v "http://localhost:4001/concat-and-send?name=mew"
docker exec -it mongodb mongosh
show dbs                        -------> 'pokemon' database has been added
use dbs
show collections                -------> 'names' collection exists
db.names.find().pretty()

'mew' and 'mewtwo' have been added to the 'pokemon' database!
